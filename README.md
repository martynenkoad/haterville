# Haterville

## A social network app for haters all around the world.

The main goal of this project has been to create a social network just for fun. 
Nowadays, most of social networks have so strict rules where it's hard to express yourself and if you're in a bad mood, want to scream at someone and you do it let's say on the Facebook then you most likely will be banned. 
In Haterville it's not always about being angry and a big dick, it's more about being funny and sarcastic person, or even if you feel a little bit toxic yourself today - nooo problem, express yourself- it's absolutely fine here :) 
so we hope you enjoy it!

## Technologies:
1. ReactJS
2. ExpressJS
3. SCSS (as a preproccessor for CSS)
4. Additionally: HTML, CSS, JS
